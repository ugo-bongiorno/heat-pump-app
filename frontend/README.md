# Frontend of the heat pump app

This is the frontend of the swimming pool heat pump app.

It is built using Angular. This is my first time doing frontend,
so it is clearly not perfect, but it does what I want.

## Setup

See [the setup in the main readme](../README.md)

## Some things that could be improved

- The design :upside_down_face:
- I have literally no clue how to unit test a frontend code, so I did not do it.
- The error handling could be improved. For instance, I could add a small pop-up at the bottom of the screen
  with the details of the error from the backend
