# Heat pump remote control app

This repo contains a small web-app to remotely control my pool's heat pump.

My heat pump has a modbus port, which allows to control it from a connected device.
My work is based on [this manual](https://gestor-doc-s3.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/documents/category/MAN10_54068-MB_ASTRALPOOLHEAT%20II%20-%20MODBUS_AP_v02_2015-.pdf) (direct download),
for a different model, which documents all the modbus messages for each functionality.
Luckily, the registers and associated values are the same for my model.
